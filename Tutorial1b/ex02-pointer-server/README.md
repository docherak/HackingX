The following program is an example of a small database server.

Consult idserver.h and idserver.c for available functions - the user can use them to print out the details of each idserver struct, modify it via pointer or create a new one.

File "pointer.c" serves as a presentation of described functions.

It uses makefile, so simply run "make" to compile. Run "make clean" to remove execs.
